# Rename TV Episodes: A Script for the Incompetent

Welcome to the pinnacle of your inadequacy: **Rename TV Episodes**, a script so basic and straightforward that one might assume even a brainless hamster could figure it out. But alas, here you are, reading this README. How tragic.

## ðŸ¤” What Does This Script Do?

This script renames your TV show episode files based on **accurate episode titles** fetched from the TVDB API. Why? Because clearly, you couldnâ€™t manage to name them properly yourself. And yes, it includes pop-up dialogs because even typing file paths is evidently beyond you.

## ðŸ›  Requirements (But You Should Know This Already, Right?)

Before you embarrass yourself further by running this, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.6+**: Hopefully, you've heard of Python before. If not, I suggest starting with "What is a computer?" tutorials.
- **Internet Connection**: Because API calls donâ€™t work offline. Shocker, right?
- **TVDB API Key**: This is a thing you'll need to set up. Head over to [TVDB](https://thetvdb.com/) and figure it out. Or is copy-pasting links too much to handle?

## ðŸ“¦ Installation (For the Hopelessly Clueless)

Letâ€™s install the only dependency you'll need, assuming your Python setup isnâ€™t as disorganized as your episode library:

```bash
pip install requests
